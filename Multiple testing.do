/*Part 1
Find a suitable sample size calculator for comparing two groups on the internet, e.g. https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/n2.html
We wish to do a trial that will test a null hypothesis comparing two treatments.
1) Find the sample size needed for testing the difference in the two groups when the standardized effect size is 0.5 (that is,(mu2-mu1)/sigma =0.5), the two-sided alpha level is 0.05 and the power required is 80%.
Sample size: 63. My mu1=20, mu2=15, sigma=12, alpha=0.05, power=.80

*/

*2) Now say that we are also testing three other hypotheses in the trial that can be considered independent of this one (so four hypotheses in total). What is the Bonferroni adjusted alpha level in this case?
